The opcode nop doesn’t do anything.

The opcode sub subtracts the top element
of the stack from the second top element of the stack.

The opcode div divides the second top element of the
stack by the top element of the stack.

The opcode mul multiplies the second top element of
the stack with the top element of the stack.

The opcode mod computes the rest of the division of the second
top element of the stack by the top element of the stack.

Every good language comes with the capability of commenting.
When the first non-space character of a line is #, treat this
